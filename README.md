## Data Visualization: How Cheap is the Oil Price
by: Philip Thomas -- P6-Make Effective Data Visualization Project

### Summary
On this project, I choose to work with my own dataset. I am fascinated by the recent movements in oil prices, and if you read from the media, the experts opinion are divided of whether the oil price is cheap or not. To do this project, I grab the data from [Quandl.com](https://www.quandl.com/) to get the historical oil prices and gold prices in monthly basis, and I also use my own collection of Big Mac Price Index, taken from The Economists magazine from 1986 to (January) 2016. 

### Design

#### Final Design Objective
My final goal is to visualize two graphs: 

- how much barrel of oil that we could buy with an ounce of gold. 
- how much Big Mac that we could buy with a barrel of oil. 



#### Data Processing (in R)


#### Plot Sketching
I made a rough plot using base graphic in R. The objective is to communicate the Bigmac per bbl of oil as shown in chart below.

However, I also would like to compare the price of gold to the price of oil. We know that gold is considered as standard currency. so I want to see historically, how many bbl per oz of gold we can buy. It is shown in chart below.
